# Kuminacha-for-TI-89-Titanium
This is a simple fun game for the TI-89 Titanium. It's an infinite side-scrolling game, where you collect certain items and avoid others. I programmed it when I was 14, but you may be surprised. I programmed it natively on the calculator in TI-BASIC, so you can view, play around with, and learn from the source code on your calculator.

Get the pun in the name? _"Kuminacha?"_ _"Comin' at ya?"_ Cool ok üòé

## How to Install the Game

## How to Play the Game
Use the Up and Down keys to control the position of your avatar (the arrow) on the right edge of the screen.
With every move of the screen, the item right in front of your avatar is collected.
Use the Left key to collect every item in the entire column in front of your avatar. 
You have a limited number of these. If you try to use this and you don't have any, nothing will happen.
At any point during the game, press the Enter key to pause the game.
> The game runs infinitely and never speeds up, so sit back and relax!

There are four possible items in gameplay:

- **`‚óã` Coins:** _Yes, you are trying to get these._ Each one counts as one point.
- **`‚ñ¢` Blocks:** _No, you are trying to avoid these._ Each one takes away 50% of your health. If you reach 0%, the game stops and your score is displayed.
- **`‚áë` Lives:** _Yes, you are trying to get these._ Each one restores 25% of your health. If you collect one and you are at full health, nothing happens.
- **`‚Åù` Powerups:** _Yes, you are trying to get these._ Each one gives you 50% of another full-column collection.
